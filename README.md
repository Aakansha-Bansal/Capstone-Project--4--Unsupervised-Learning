# Capstone-Project--4--Unsupervised-Learning

This is an Unsupervised Machine learning project in this project I will build a model that can be capable of clustering different-different types of data. The dataset is about netflix shows which has 7787 rows and 12 columns like show_id which represents ID of the show, type represents type of the show, title represents show title, cast represents name of the casting stars, country represents the country of the show, date added represents the date when the show is added to netflix, release_year represents the year the show was released,rating represents the rating of the show, duration represents the length of the show, listed_in tells what type and where the show belongs from, description gives short descriptions about the show. My task is to read and understand the data after that I will have to show some meaningfull charts and explain everything about the chart then according to the visualization chart I will have to make some hypothesis assumptions about the project then testing the assumptions. Then I will handle missing and null values and outliers after completing these all task I will look for imbalanced data if there is any imbalanced data then I will have to deal with that. Then I will select some important features further I will split the data for test and training purpose and after doing all this I will implement the machine learning models.
